## Overview

This project is a fully functional **todo list manager** implemented as an MVC application with SPA functionality. It uses a **frontend JavaScript-based SPA** to dynamically update the todo list without refreshing the page. The backend consists of an **ASP.NET MVC** architecture (Controllers, Views, Models) with **Entity Framework Core** for database management.

- **Mark Todos as Complete/Incomplete**: Easily toggle completion status.
- **Real-time Updates**: Todos list refreshes automatically after every operation.
- **Robust Feedback**: Confirmation messages for pending and successful updates.
- **Database Support**: Built entirely on **SQL Server** via **Entity Framework Core**.
